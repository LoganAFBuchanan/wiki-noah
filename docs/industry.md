# :moneybag: The Industry

The medium of games is incredibly inspiring to creative individuals, but is still in the throes of stigmatization, and for absolutely wrong reasons. The games industry has problems, but they're not the ones in the public lens.

## :thumbsup: The Pros

Alright, so you're interested in the games industry. Here are some reasons I encourage jumping in:

### Community

(Coming Soon) Concerning the fact that game developers stick together, help each other, take each others' cards, listen to one another, and give eachother validation and support.

### Dreambuilding

(Coming Soon) How game development lets you do anything, and why it's perhaps the best known analog for designing your own universe, and also an opportunity to create living art, developing intense aesthetics through the power of interaction, and affecting people through how they interact with your piece.

### Transferability

(Coming Soon) Why games are easy to get into, interesting from a lot of different creative angles of entry, and why games teach you various skills and plan B's if things don't work out.

## :thumbsdown: The Cons

And here are some reservations I have about the industry, which although aren't enough to keep me away, may be serious enough that it turns you off games as a career:

### Hollywood Has It Easier

(Coming Soon) Games are **hard** to make. Often much harder to make than movies, and some tips for keeping your scope down. Additionally, lots of game studios go the route of hollywood trying to make 'safe' games - and why that doesn't work for indie devs.

### Job Security Who?

(Coming Soon) Concerning a side-effect of the difficulty of making games, lots of studios underestimate the costs of developing them, but also underestimate the power of the game developer community.
