# :snake: Virtro Wiki

## Version 1.4.1 (Snake) - March 12th, 2018

### Poetry Version 0.2.2

# Preface
*there once were two students called Noah and Tony*

*who learned things the hard way, despite all the groaning*

*they needed a way to teach all they'd done*

*so they wrote this fun wiki - hope it's helpful for some*

*and one day when you're on the same page as Team Virtro*

*...* [Tony if you have time please finish this rhyme I'm having writer's block.]

# Getting Started

Hi, *don't freak out*. Welcome to your repository, and welcome to the Virtro Wiki to which you are reading. If you're curious, this text is from the `readme.md` file within the Git repo's root. Any changes made to the Markdown (.md) files in the root will be reflected here once those changes have been pushed. Don't know what a push is? [We've got documentation for that!](git.md#committing-pushing)

By working at Virtro as a developer, you're also a game designer. You will need to make on-the-fly calls about what is best for the player's experience. **For this reason, one of the most important reads for you is [The Basics of Fun](development.md#the-basics-of-fun).** This is perhaps the most valuable one-pager you'll read on the wiki, because it will affect how you do *everything* during development.

We recommend taking the time to learn [our protocol surrounding Git](git.md#repository-protocol), as well as refresh yourself on [the basics](git.md#-git-basics). This is especially important since we use a commandline interface. There is no guess-work involved, and there aren't any confirmation boxes saying *"ARE YOU SURE?"*.

Additionally, there is a boatload of fantastic and less-than-obvious tips, tricks and tools relating to [Unity](development.md#-unity) and [C#](development.md#-code) which we have poured our souls into.

If you're relatively new to the game development field this wiki is for you. It doesn't teach you the basics of programming, but it gives you enough knowledge that you can rub shoulders with seasoned developers.
