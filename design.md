Time to make a game!

Here's some tips for doing that.

## :seedling: Game Ethics

As with any creative medium, I feel it's important to be cognisant of the ethics of the product we develop. Unlike many other mediums, games have the addition of interaction, which opens a floodgate of concerns, especially relating to accessibility, and player psychology. However, I thought it would be good to talk a little bit about my experiences with AI, and some thinking I've done on the subject.

### Violence as a Tool, Violence as a Crutch

(Coming Soon) Concerning the bloated dead myths around 'videogame violence', but also violence as narrative, violence for aesthetics, and violence as a cultural fixation within the industry.

### Representation, Identity, and Puppeteering

(Coming Soon) Concerning developing with sensitivity, a look at cultural appropriation, and the complications of representational consent of having a game avatar when the player is arbitrary.

### Exploitation, Whales, and Dice

(Coming Soon) Concerning predatory monetization, player behaviour, and gambling.

### Artificial Lines

(Coming Soon) Concerning artificial intelligence, humility, and my thoughts on how to approach development in burgeoning fields of intelligence emulation.

## :space_invader: Game Design

As a developer in a small team, you'll often have to make calls about design decisions when your designer is away for lunch, or even just because you're expected to know the answer. The basics of game design are more-or-less as follows:

### The Basics of Fun

1. Games are greater than the sum of their parts. 
    * If something isn't feeling good, add sound, animation principles, visual polish, agency, responsiveness, cinematography, tone, etc...
    * Good game developers can use the full spectrum of the medium to add flare and satisfaction to a part of a game.
    * GREAT game developers can make something look and feel good using only a couple of the aforementioned components.
2. Player input needs to be responsive.
    * It needs have have punch and it needs to feel good. 
    * If you need to slow the responsiveness of something down, use [animation principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation) to give it physicality. 
    * Dark Souls does this really well. Attacks don't happen instantly, but have anticipation, windup, followthrough, and there is a noticable secondary impact motion on the enemies which helps communicate your power.
3. Design toward an experience. Design by subtraction.
    * Everything in your game should bring it closer to a particular experiential aesthetic. Decide on that aesthetic early, and tailor EVERYTHING towards it.
    * Often the best way to make something better is to take something out of it. We make assumptions constantly about what 'should' be in a game. In the example of Zombie Donuts we let the player move around the environment, and due to the limitations of the Gear VR players didn't like the control scheme and felt sick because of it. Players had more fun by standing still.
    * If you want a great example of design by subtraction take a look at one of my favourite game designers of all time - Fumito Ueda's [Shadow of the Colossus](http://www.thesaint-online.com/2017/03/fumito-ueda-design-by-subtraction/) and [Ico.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmSBIyT0ih0)
4. Fuck tutorials.
    * If you can make a game entirely without tutorials, do it. 
    * In addition to forcing you to make a terrible bastardization of your gameplay loop, players hate them. 
    * Players hate reading, feeling patronized, and having the discovery of mechanics spoiled for them.
5. Teach the player without them noticing.
    * Use light or colour :rainbow: to guide the eye to important gameplay elements. 
    * Use sound to cue the player to look in a direction. Use framing to focus the player on important elements. 
    * Use visual weight (notice how the rainbow emoji draws your eye because it has a bolder visual presence than the rest of the text) to draw attention. 
    * Force the player using psychology to teach themselves how to play the game. It's hard but when it's done right it's phenomenal.

### XR-Specific

XR, which is a blanket term for VR, AR, MR (Mixed Reality) and other such designations, have some interesting design concerns associated with them, mostly around input and interaction. For those User Experience (UX) people out there, this might be interesting for you.

Here's a list of useful guidelines:

1. Make interactions kinetic! (Give them physicality and weight.)
    1. Have the player directly influence items in the game world or on the phone screen. 
    2. Don't rely on buttons and floating UI.
2. Avoid unmotivated movement, perspective shifts of any sort, and even movement in general if you can.
    1. Doing something like changing the Field of View in VR is such a no-no that most VR SDKs and APIs totally lock it.
3. Make intuitive or charming environmental interactions instead of buttons. 
    1. Ex. Toggle the music by having the player shoot a jukebox.

If you must do movement, try some of the following options:

1. Fade/blink to an indicated location.
2. **Slow** movement using conventional control schemes. Must be a decent controller with accurate directional and analog input.
3. Constant and linear movement. (See Run Dorothy Run)
4. Deliberate physical movement.
    1. Using motion controllers to swim or push off objects in space. 
    2. Needs to be tuned to feel physically true-to-life, make sure there are no physics glitches that will make you instantly barf. :mask:
    3. One game that does this REALLY well is [Lone Echo](https://youtu.be/zxPuZYMIzuQ?t=3457) which gets around this problem by having the player in zero-grav environments for the entirety of the game. You also see your body if you look down. Super cool.

## :camera: Case Studies

The best way to make good games is to play both good and bad games. Play a lot of them. Talk to friends about them. Analyze them.

### Shadow of The Colossus

(Coming Soon) Using feature subtraction, emptiness, scale, and grace, to evoke intense aesthetics.

### Dark Souls

(Coming Soon) Using adversity to enforce triumph. Forcing players to confront thoughtful play. Being okay with players missing a secret.
