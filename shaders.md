# üêâ Shaders

Shaders are perhaps my favourite thing to code, and also among the least approachable things to code. Their effects are seen far and wide in games, and a good shader can be a thing of beauty.

Shaders are used to give materiality to objects, style to a project, post-processing, and any multitude of visual effects.
